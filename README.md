# UrlShortenerWebApp

âš  A light-hearted side project, completed in about an hour, just to indulge my coding cravings and having git activity! ðŸ˜…

This is a web application developed using ASP.NET Core, focusing on web development, MVC pattern, handling HTTP requests, and potentially including database interaction for persisting short URLs.

## Description

Users can visit the website to input a long URL, and the application will generate a short URL. The website is designed to redirect users from the short URL to the original one.
